Another pencil made entirely of lead. Like the previous one in my collection from the [Pompidou Museum](?display=centre-pompidou), this one had a broken writing tip, they are so fragile.

Incidentally, the Louvre in Abu Dhabi is a museum opened with France, for thirty years they have secured the name, support and collections of the [original Louvre](?display=louvre). Apparently with lead pencils too.
